# Games-Menu
This is an interactive platform developed in python using tkinter which consists of three games contained in it, which you can play using an interactive menu.

To run the program you just have to run the main.py file contained inside the folder.
And then you will have to register yourself and enjoy playing the Games.

To view the admin panel/all records of user logins in your program, you will have to enter the username- admin and password- 12345 while logging in the program.

Hope you will enjoy Playing the GAMES !!!
